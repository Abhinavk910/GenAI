The banking innovator is the sixth-largest holding in the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKF), making up 5% of the fund's total assets.  You'll also find about $95 million worth of SoFi stock in the flagship ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKK), and it's also worth noting that the SoFi app is the exclusive distribution partner for the ARK Venture Fund (NASDAQMUTFUND: ARKVX), which allows investors to get exposure to companies like SpaceX and OpenAI before their initial public offering.\",\n",
